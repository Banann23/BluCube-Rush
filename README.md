# BluCube Rush

A small browser runner game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This is one of my first experiments with creating a game in JS, made about a year ago, added here as part of my portfolio.

## 📌 Notes

This project is not polished — it's simply a snapshot of my early learning phase in JavaScript.  
Added here to show progression in my coding journey. 
⚠️ Note: The game was designed on Full HD screen (1920x1080).  
On larger resolutions, some graphics or layout elements may not display perfectly.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 🎮 About the Game

A simple **dino-like game**: control a small blue character that moves forward automatically.  
Avoid randomly appearing enemies by jumping over ground enemies or crouching under flying enemies.  

The game has:
- Basic collision detection  
- Simple sprite animations  
- Score counter with milestone sounds  
- Background music and sound effects (from World of Warcraft)
- Best score tracking in the current session  

Nothing fancy — just a simple project showing early steps in JS development.
